## About Me

Hi! My name is Priscilla, and I am a first year Master's student at Aalto University, majoring in Machine Learning. I am also part of the doctoral track.
This means I get to participate in research activities based in the Department of Computer Science:)

I am excited about using machine learning, and more broadly, data-driven techniques to deliver impactful solutions.


## Projects

Some of my past (and ongoing) projects can be found below:

### Bayesian

- [AntMAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/AntMAN/index.html): an R package fitting finite mixture models with a random number of components.
- Research Experience Project 1: Performed preliminary studies of encoding a linear(-mixed model) prior into a Variational AutoEncoder.

### Reinforcement Learning

- [Deep offline reinforcement learning for real-world treatment optimization applications](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pKkq17YQgK1): in submission
- [A mini-class project](https://pixieprix-rl-final-projectstreamlit-projectstreamlit-app-eekbxl.streamlit.app/): Implemented DQN and DDPG on the mountaincar environment. Also implemented and provided a summary of a more recent paper: Dueling network architectures for deep reinforcement learning.


### General Machine Learning:

- Predicting patient outcomes based on real-world Electronic Healthcare Records. Looked at quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions.
