## About Me

Hi! My name is Priscilla, and I am a first year Master's student at Aalto University, majoring in Machine Learning. I am also part of the doctoral track.
This means I get to participate in research activities based in the Department of Computer Science:)

I am excited about using machine learning, and more broadly, data-driven techniques to deliver impactful solutions.
