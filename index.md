<!-- ### Exciting stuff I've been part of:

 - [AntMAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/AntMAN/index.html): Contributed to an R package for fitting finite mixture models with a random number of components.

 - [Deep offline reinforcement learning for real-world treatment optimization applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07549): Accepted at 29th SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2023 (Applied Data Science Track).

## About Me

Hi! I am Priscilla. I will be graduating with a Masterâ€™s degree from Aalto University this December, specializing in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. 

I am passionate about problem-solving, with a strong interest in leveraging data-driven approaches to uncover meaningful insights. I am also motivated by the opportunity to contribute to the development of technical products with real-world impact.

## Exciting stuff I have been part of:

Some of my past (and ongoing) projects can be found below:

#### Machine Learning Research:

- [LMM-VAE](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6huQApLcJK): Designed a scalable and effective framework to model longitudinal data. Presented at ICML SPIGM 2024 and ML4H 2024 (Findings).   
- [Deep offline reinforcement learning for real-world treatment optimization applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07549): Contributed to a project on treatment optimization for healthcare applications. Accepted at 29th SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2023.
- [AntMAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/AntMAN/index.html): Contributed to an R package for fitting finite mixture models with a random number of components.
- My Master's thesis: Explored continuous time deep learning approaches for modelling longitudinal data (TLDR).


#### Reinforcement Learning:

- [A mini-class project](https://pixieprix-rl-final-projectstreamlit-projectstreamlit-app-eekbxl.streamlit.app/): Implemented DQN and DDPG on the mountaincar environment. Also implemented and provided a summary of a more recent paper: Dueling network architectures for deep reinforcement learning.

#### Natural Language Processing:

- [A mini-personal project](https://github.com/pixieprix/MaLSTM): Largely replicated the model architecture detailed in the paper titled Siamese Recurrent Architectures for Learning Sentence Similarity. 

#### Others:

- [Vaccine Distribution](https://project-vaccine-distribution.streamlit.app/): Contributed to the design and implementation of a database for vaccine distribution as part of a course project.

- [Job-search](https://github.com/pixieprix/job_search): Implemented a mini web-app that visualizes scraped data pertaining to job advertisements found on indeed.com. Built with Selenium and BeautifulSoup (webscraper), Sqlite (Database), FastAPI (Backend), Streamlit (Frontend UI), and Docker.

## Miscellaneous

I also enjoy collaborating with people on various fronts. I have been an orientation group leader, vice-captain of the NUS waterpolo team, and co-organised a virtual team-building event for my division during my time at ASTAR.  More recently, I volunteered as a Speaker's buddy/ joined the Partner Side Events Team  @ Slush 2022/2023 in Helsinki.
