## About Me

Hi! My name is Priscilla, and I am a first year Master's student at Aalto University, majoring in Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I am also part of the doctoral track.
This means I get to participate in research activities based in the Department of Computer Science:)

I am excited about using data-driven techniques to solve pertinent problems.


## Projects

Some of my past (and ongoing) projects which have been organised somewhat thematically can be found below:

#### General Machine Learning:

- Predicted patient outcomes based on real-world Electronic Healthcare Records. Looked at quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions.

#### Bayesian:

- [AntMAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/AntMAN/index.html): an R package fitting finite mixture models with a random number of components.
- Research Experience Project 1: Performed preliminary studies of encoding a linear(-mixed model) prior into a Variational AutoEncoder.

#### Reinforcement Learning:

- [Deep offline reinforcement learning for real-world treatment optimization applications](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pKkq17YQgK1): in submission
- [A mini-class project](https://pixieprix-rl-final-projectstreamlit-projectstreamlit-app-eekbxl.streamlit.app/): Implemented DQN and DDPG on the mountaincar environment. Also implemented and provided a summary of a more recent paper: Dueling network architectures for deep reinforcement learning.

#### Natural Language Processing:

- [A mini-personal project](https://github.com/pixieprix/MaLSTM): Largely replicated the model detailed in the paper titled Siamese Recurrent Architectures for Learning Sentence Similarity. 

#### Others:

- [job-search](https://github.com/pixieprix/job_search): A mini web-app that visualises scraped data pertaining to job advertisements. Built with Selenium and BeautifulSoup (Scraper), Sqlite (Database), FastAPI (Backend), Streamlit (Frontend UI), and Docker.


## Miscellaneous

Aside from research, I enjoy interacting and interfacing with people! I have been an orientation group leader, vice-captain of the NUS waterpolo team, and also co-organised a virtual team-building event for my division during my time at ASTAR. More recently, I volunteered as a Speaker's buddy @ Slush 2022.
